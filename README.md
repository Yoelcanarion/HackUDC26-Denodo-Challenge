# HackUDC26-Denodo-Challenge

This command-line tool utilizes the Denodo AI SDK and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture to solve complex business problems in two phases (Metadata Discovery + Data Execution). 

Instead of a standard conversational chatbot, this is a fully autonomous analytical tool that processes natural language criteria and returns data-driven conclusions.

##  How to Run the Project Locally

Follow these steps to set up the environment and run the decision engine smoothly on any operating system.
